    <h3><em>This spaghetti and meatball recipe is the ultimate weeknight family dinner — quick, easy, and picky eater-approved!</em></h3>
    <p>This is my go-to recipe for spaghetti and meatballs. With a quick 45-minute cook time, it’s perfect for busy weeknights and sure to please even the pickiest eaters. The meatballs are juicy and packed with flavor, with a fork-tender texture that keeps everyone coming back for more.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 good-quality pork sausages</li>
    <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
    <li>85g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
    <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten with a fork</li>
    <li>olive oil, for roasting</li>
    <li>spaghetti, to serve (about 100g per portion)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Meatball Sauce</h3>
<ul>
   <li> 3 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
<li>4 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>125ml red wine (optional)</li>
<li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
<li>½ a large bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>few basil leaves (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>

<li>First, make the meatballs. Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.</li>

<li>Add the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well – the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.</li>


<li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.</li>


<li>Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.</li>


<li>Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.</li>


<li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.</li>


<li>Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.</li>


<li>Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.</li>
</ol>
